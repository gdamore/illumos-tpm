illumos-tpm README - Dec 3, 2014.

This tree is an extraction of the TPM driver & PKCS#11 module from
illumos-gate.

The TPM module offers a limited set of cryptographic services, and
is intended as a starting point for secure key management, etc.
It requires the TrouSerS package (SUNWtss historically) and thus also
OpenSSL.

In practice, its likely that these are of little utility, since the
necessary cryptographic signing of executable code, and connection to
firmware, mean that a true trusted platform is not really viable
for illumos distributions.  (Apparently Oracle Solaris 11 can get there
but only on T5 based SPARC systems.)

The idea is that this represents a new "consolidation" separate from illumos
proper, so that distributions that have no need for these bits can dispense
with them.

This builds like illumos-gate, and has packages.  However, it needs the
following to be installed on the build system:

	* pkg:/library/security/trousers
	* pkg:/developer/build/onbld

It does not support linting -- the problem is that some header files are
included that ultimately include non-delivered header files, when lint
is defined.  This comes about as a result of use of some private header
files by the TPM kernel driver.

Also, you'll need the appropriate C compiler.  It should use the
same as illumos-gate to build.
